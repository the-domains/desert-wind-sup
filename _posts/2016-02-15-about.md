Hey...

Thanks for checking us out. We're paddlers that like to enjoy the simpler things in life. We love to share our passion for SUP with other people. We are easygoing, knowledgeable people who believe that you get out of life what you put into it. We have a passion for introducing people to the sport (read - we aren't trying to sell you something.) We genuinely want people to try and see if SUP is right for them.

There is a kind of SUP for everyone. Some people race, some people yoga, others use SUP to connect with nature, some people fish (yep...fish from a Paddleboard!) Whatever the kind of experience you're looking for, we'll help you find it.
