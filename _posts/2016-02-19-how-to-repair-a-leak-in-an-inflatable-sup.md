description: "An inflatable SUP is always a delicate equipment. Rocks, corals, nails, sharp objects, and daily handling can easily cause holes and tears in the tissue. The world's best inflatable stand-up paddleboards can usually handle heavy beatings, but sometimes it is just too much. If you found that your SUP is leaking air, don't panic."
