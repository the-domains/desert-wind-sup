Here at Desert Wind SUP, we want everyone to have a good experience when they go out on the water. To do that we hold to one of the highest standards of training in the industry - [PaddleFitPro CORE Certification][0]. Now, we still don't take ourselves to seriously, but you should feel good knowing that we have training from some of the best and first innovators in the sport.

If you are in the Phoenix area and would like lessons, give us a call or shoot us an email. We'd be happy to set something up for you.
